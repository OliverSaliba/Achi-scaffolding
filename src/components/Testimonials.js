The villa was not in a construction phase. It is already inhabited. It is a very high end sensitive space. We needed to install the AC DUCTS. We were advised Achi group. Their workers highly respected the space and they were so involved in leaving the area clean and in delivering a very neat product. We highly recommend this company.
This experience with Achi group is to be repeated without any doubt. Thank you
